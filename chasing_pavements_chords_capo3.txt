[Intro]
 
Am  G6
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am7                          G6
I've made up my mind - don't need to think it over, If I'm
Fmaj7                   E7
wrong I am right - don't need to look no further
          F                   Em  G7
This ain't lust,      I~~~~~~~~~know, this is
C       Am      G6
love              But
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C                     Em/B
If I tell the world, - I'll never say enough 'Cause it was 
Am                             E            E7/B
not said to you - And that's exactly what I need to do if
F          Em7           F  G
I - e~~~~~nd up,        with you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F           Em  -  Am  -  Dm                       F
Should I give up, - or should I just keep chasing pavements
G6        Em      E7/B
Even if it leads nowhere
F              Em - Am - Dm                F
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
G6                E7
Should I leave it there
F           Em  -  Am  -  Dm                       F
Should I give up, - or should I just keep chasing pavements
G6                E7            C
E~~~~~ven if it - leads nowhere - yeah
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Am7                    G6
I build myself up - and fly around in circles, 
        Fmaj7                  E7
waiting as my heart drops - And my back begins to tingle 
    F                          Em7      F G
finally,        co~~~~~uld this be,     it  or
 
 
[Chorus]
 

[Bridge]
 
F                            Em
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
     Dm                   G7
Even if, - it leads - nowhere
         F                       E7
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place
                   D                G
Should I leave it there? Should I give up
            F          Em - Am -  Dm         F
Or should I just, keep on - chasing - pavements
         Em7        Am       Dm        F
Should I just keep on – chasing – pavements
 
F   G
OH…   OH…
 
 
[Chorus]
