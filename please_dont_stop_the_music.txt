Its getting late
                  C/E
I'm making my way over to
   F
My favourite place
                    G6
I gotta get my body moving
          Am
Shake the stress away
                       G6
I wasn't looking for nobody
         Am

                  C/E
Possible candidate, yeah
F
Who knew
                    C/E
That you'd be up in here
        F
Looking like you do
                      G6
You're making staying over here
  Am
Impossible
                           G6

     Am

I just came here to party
 
Now we're rocking on the dancefloor
G6             Am
Acting naughty
                           Cmaj9
Your hands around my waist
                        Em7
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest and now we're face to face
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Fmaj9              Am
I wanna take you away

Lets escape into the music
